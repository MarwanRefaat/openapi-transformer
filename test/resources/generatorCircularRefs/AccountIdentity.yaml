  account_id:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Plaidâ€™s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change
      unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the
      financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the
      account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to
      the account.


      The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the
      same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used
      to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new
      `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.


      If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing,
      the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the
      Plaid API.


      Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.
  balances:
    $ref: ./AccountBalance.yaml
  mask:
    description: >-
      The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of an account's official account
      number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item's accounts,
      and it may also not match the mask that the bank displays to the user.
  name:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial
      institution itself
  official_name:
    description: The official name of the account as given by the financial institution
  type:
    $ref: ./AccountType.yaml
  subtype:
    $ref: ./AccountSubtype.yaml
  verification_status:
    $ref: ./VerificationStatus.yaml
  owners:
    type: array
    description: >-
      Data returned by the financial institution about the account owner or
      owners. Only returned by Identity or Assets endpoints. Multiple owners on
      a single account will be represented in the same `owner` object, not in
      multiple owner objects within the array. In API versions 2018-05-22 and
      earlier, the `owners` object is not returned, and instead identity
      information is returned in the top level `identity` object. For more
      details, see [Plaid API
      versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2019-05-29)
