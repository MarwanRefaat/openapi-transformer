  If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as
  `/transactions/get`, the `payment_meta` key will always appear, but no data
  elements are guaranteed. If the `transactions` object was returned by an
  Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this
  field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
