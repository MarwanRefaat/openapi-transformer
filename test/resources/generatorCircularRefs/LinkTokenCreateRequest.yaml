  client_name:
    type: string
    description: >-
      CONSTANT The name of your application, as it should be displayed in Link.
      Maximum length of 30 characters. If a value longer than 30 characters is
      provided, Link will display "This Application" instead.
  language:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The language that Link should be displayed in.


      Supported languages are:

      - English (`'en'`)

      - French (`'fr'`)

      - Spanish (`'es'`)

      - Dutch (`'nl'`)

      - German(`'de'`)


      When using a Link customization, the language configured here must match
      the setting in the customization, or the customization will not be
      applied.
  country_codes:
    minItems: 1
    type: array
    description: >-
      Specify an array of Plaid-supported country codes using the ISO-3166-1
      alpha-2 country code standard. Institutions from all listed countries will
      be shown.  Supported country codes are: `US`, `CA`, `DE`, `ES`, `FR`,
      `GB`, `IE`, `NL`. For a complete mapping of supported products by country,
      see https://plaid.com/global/.


      If Link is launched with multiple country codes, only products that you
      are enabled for in all countries will be used by Link. Note that while all
      countries are enabled by default in Sandbox and Development, in Production
      only US and Canada are enabled by default. To gain access to European
      institutions in the Production environment, [file a product access Support
      ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access)
      via the Plaid dashboard. If you initialize with a European country code,
      your users will see the European consent panel during the Link flow.


      If using a Link customization, make sure the country codes in the
      customization match those specified in `country_codes`. If both
      `country_codes` and a Link customization are used, the value in
      `country_codes` may override the value in the customization.


      If using the Auth features Instant Match, Same-day Micro-deposits, or
      Automated Micro-deposits, `country_codes` must be set to `['US']`.
    items:
      $ref: ./CountryCode.yaml
  user:
    $ref: ./LinkTokenCreateRequestUser.yaml
  products:
    uniqueItems: true
    type: array
    description: >-
      List of Plaid product(s) you wish to use. If launching Link in update
      mode, should be omitted; required otherwise. Valid products are:


      `transactions`, `auth`, `identity`, `assets`, `investments`,
      `liabilities`, `payment_initiation`, `deposit_switch`,
      `income_verification`, `transfer`


      `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require
      explicit initalization and will automatically be initialized when any
      other product is initialized.


      Only institutions that support *all* requested products will be shown in
      Link; to maximize the number of institutions listed, it is recommended to
      initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case.
      Additional products can be added after Link initialization by calling the
      relevant endpoints. For details and exceptions, see [Choosing when to
      initialize
      products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/best-practices/#choosing-when-to-initialize-products).


      Note that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support,
      institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if
      `auth` is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not
      contain `auth` in their product array.


      In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when
      initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once
      the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an
      Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments,
      and Transactions, remove the Item via `/item/remove`.

  webhook:
    type: string
    description: The destination URL to which any webhooks should be sent.
  access_token:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The `access_token` associated with the Item to update, used when updating
      or modifying an existing `access_token`. Used when launching Link in
      update mode, when completing the Same-day (manual) Micro-deposit flow, or
      (optionally) when initializing Link as part of the Payment Initiation (UK
      and Europe) flow.
  link_customization_name:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The name of the Link customization from the Plaid Dashboard to be applied
      to Link. If not specified, the `default` customization will be used. When
      using a Link customization, the language in the customization must match
      the language selected via the `language` parameter, and the countries in
      the customization should match the country codes selected via
      `country_codes`.
  redirect_uri:
    type: string
    description: >-
      A URI indicating the destination where a user should be forwarded after
      completing the Link flow; used to support OAuth authentication flows when
      launching Link in the browser or via a webview. The `redirect_uri` should
      not contain any query parameters. When used in Production or Development,
      must be an https URI. To specify any subdomain, use `*` as a wildcard
      character, e.g. `https://*.example.com/oauth.html`. If
      `android_package_name` is specified, this field should be left blank. 
      Note that any redirect URI must also be added to the Allowed redirect URIs
      list in the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api).
