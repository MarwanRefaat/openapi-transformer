  account_id:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Plaidâ€™s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change
      unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the
      financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the
      account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to
      the account.


      The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the
      same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used
      to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new
      `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.


      If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing,
      the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the
      Plaid API.


      Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

  mask:
    description: >-

      and it may also not match the mask that the bank displays to the user.

    description: >-
      The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial
      institution itself
