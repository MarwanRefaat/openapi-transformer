      level, if any can be identified.


      `causes` will only be provided for the `error_type` `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR`.

  We use standard HTTP response codes for success and failure notifications, and
  our errors are further classified by `error_type`. In general, 200 HTTP codes
  correspond to success, 40X codes are for developer- or user-related failures,
  and 50X codes are for Plaid-related issues.  Error fields will be `null` if no
  error has occurred.
