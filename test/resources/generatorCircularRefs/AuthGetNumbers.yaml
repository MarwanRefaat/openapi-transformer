description: >-
  An object containing identifying numbers used for making electronic transfers
  to and from the `accounts`. The identifying number type (ACH, EFT, IBAN, or
  BACS) used will depend on the country of the account. An account may have more
  than one number type. If a particular identifying number type is not used by
  any `accounts` for which data has been requested, the array for that type will
  be empty.
