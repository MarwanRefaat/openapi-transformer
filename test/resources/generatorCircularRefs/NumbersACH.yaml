      Note that when using OAuth with Chase Bank (`ins_56`), Chase will issue
      "tokenized" routing and account numbers, which are not the user's actual
      account and routing numbers. These tokenized numbers should work
      identically to normal account and routing numbers. The digits returned in
      the `mask` field will continue to reflect the actual account number,
      rather than the tokenized account number; for this reason, when displaying
      account numbers to the user to help them identify their account in your
      UI, always use the `mask` rather than truncating the `account` number. If
      a user revokes their permissions to your app, the tokenized numbers will
      continue to work for ACH deposits, but not withdrawals.
  routing:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The ACH routing number for the account. If the institution is `ins_56`,
      this may be a tokenized routing number. For more information, see the
      description of the `account` field.
  wire_routing:
    description: The wire transfer routing number for the account, if available
description: >-
  Identifying information for transferring money to or from a US account via ACH
  or wire transfer.
