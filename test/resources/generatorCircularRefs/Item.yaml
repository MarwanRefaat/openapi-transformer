type: object
properties:
  item_id:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The Plaid Item ID. The `item_id` is always unique; linking the same
      account at the same institution twice will result in two Items with
      different `item_id` values. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `item_id` is
      case-sensitive.
  institution_id:
    description: >-
      The Plaid Institution ID associated with the Item. Field is `null` for
      Items created via Same Day Micro-deposits.
  webhook:
    description: The URL registered to receive webhooks for the Item.

  billed_products:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A list of products that have been billed for the Item. Note -
      `billed_products` is populated in all environments but only requests in
      Production are billed.

      $ref: ./Products.yaml
  consent_expiration_time:
    description: >-
      The RFC 3339 timestamp after which the consent provided by the end user
      will expire. Upon consent expiration, the item will enter the
      `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` error state. To circumvent the `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED`
      error and maintain continuous consent, the end user can reauthenticate via
      Linkâ€™s update mode in advance of the consent expiration time.


      Note - This is only relevant for certain OAuth-based institutions. For all
      other institutions, this field will be null.
